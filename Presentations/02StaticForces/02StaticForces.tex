				A rectangular steel gate ($1.5\,\text{m}\times2.15\,\text{m}$) is used to regulate the level of a water storage pond. The gate has a weight of $1.9\,\text{kN}$ which can be thought of as acting through the centre of the gate.\parb
				Determine the force $T$ required to open the gate when the pond has a depth of $3.1\,\text{m}$.

				A $L$-shaped steel gate $ABC$ is used to regulate the level of a water storage pond.
				Both the vertical and the horizontal parts of the gate are rectangular with a width of $1.75\,\text{m}$.
				When the water level exceeds a certain level, the whole gate $ABC$ rotates clockwise about the frictionless hinge at $B$.
				\par \bigskip
				Determine the value of $h$ at which the gate begins to open.
