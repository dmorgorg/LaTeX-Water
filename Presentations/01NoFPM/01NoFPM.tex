		      	\begin{mybox}[width=4cm,top=-0.1cm]
		      		\[ p_{abs}=p_{atm}+p_{gauge} \]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Absolute and Gauge Pressure}
	\cmini{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item When using a tire-gauge to check the pressure in a car or a bicycle tire,
			      the tire-gauge reports gauge pressure; this is the amount of pressure
			      in the tire in excess of the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.\pause\parb
			\item If a tire-gauge reports a pressure of 275 kPa and the atmospheric
			      pressure is $101.3\,\text{kPa (abs)}$, then the absolute pressure inside the
			      tire is 376.3 kPa\pause\parb
			\item Normal pressure at sea-level is $101.3$ kPa (or $14.7$ psi) but changes with the weather. The highest
			      recorded pressure (adjusted to sea-level) of 110.0 kPa was measured in the middle of Siberia and the lowest of 89.1~kPa in a typhoon in the South Pacific.
			      \pause\parb
			\item Atmospheric pressure also varies with altitude. The pressure at the top of Everest is approximately one-third of that at sea-level (and contains one-third of the oxygen available at sea-level).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Pressure and Elevation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pressure decreases with increased elevation in the atmosphere; the
		      atmospheric pressure in Leh, India, ($3500$ m above sea-level) should be around $65\,$kPa. (Pressure usually decreases about $10\,$kPa for every elevation gain of $1\,000\,\text{m}$.) \pause\parm
		\item Weather stations do not normally display this difference due to elevation;
		      the stations adjust the pressure for elevation.
		      Thus, $103.1\,$kPa was the reported pressure in Leh on Monday 9th January, 2017, at 12.05pm. This adjustment enables us to know something about the weather conditions in a particular location without knowing the elevation and making calculations.\pars

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Pressure and Elevation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pressure increases with increased depth in a fluid. The pressure at
		      the bottom of the deep end in a swimming pool is noticeably greater
		      than just below the surface. \pause\parb
		\item In fluid mechanics, \emph{elevation} refers to the vertical distance
		      from some reference point to a point of interest. (Death Valley is
		      $86\,\text{m}$\textbf{ below sea-level}). \pause\parb
		\item Elevation relative to some reference level is usually denoted by $\bm z$. \lb A difference in elevation between two points is usually denoted by $\bm h$.

\begin{frame}{Pressure and Elevation}
	
	
	The change in pressure in a homogeneous liquid at rest due to change
	in elevation is given by:

		\gamma & = & \text{specific weight of  liquid}\\
		h & = & \text{change in elevation}

	Note:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item This equation does not apply to gases
		\item Points at the same elevation (same horizontal level) have the same
		      pressure (see Pascal's Paradox)
		\item This equation is stated for absolute values of change in pressure. \lb Pressure increases with increased depth.
