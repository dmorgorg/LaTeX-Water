	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Determine what is already known or given
		\item Determine what is to be calculated
		\item Choose two appropriate or convenient sections at which to apply Bernoulli's Equation
		\item Use the equation \textbf{in the direction of the flow}. That is, section $1$ should be upstream
		      of section $2$ (or, equivalently, fluid flow should go from the left hand side of the equation to the right
		      hand side of the equation).
		\item Cancel terms that are $0$ or that are the same on both sides of the equation
		      \begin{itemize}
		      	\item Tanks, reservoirs or nozzles exposed to the atmosphere have zero pressure so the pressure head term can be removed
		      	      from the calculation
		      	\item The velocity head at the surface of a tank or reservoir is assumed to be zero
