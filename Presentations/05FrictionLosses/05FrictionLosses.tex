			      \item<2-> Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912) demonstrated the difference between these flow classifications
			      by injecting dye into a pipe containing a flow of water:
			\item[]
			      \item<3-> For a sufficiently low velocity,  the dye \newline streak  will remain a well-defined line.
			      \newline Adjacent layers in the flow do not mix; \newline this is laminar flow.
			\item[]\par\vspace{0.1cm}
			      \item<4-> For a sufficiently high velocity, the dye \newline streak quickly spreads across
			      the pipe, \newline mixing with the water in the pipe. \newline This is turbulent flow.
			\item []\par\vspace{0.1cm}

		\item Type of flow (in circular pipes) is dependent upon the density, viscosity and velocity of the fluid, and upon
		      the inside diameter of the pipe.
