  \begin{itemize}
   \item<1-> The flow in a pipe may be \textbf{laminar}, \textbf{turbulent} or \textbf{transitional}.\parb
   \item<2-> Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912) demonstrated the difference between these flow classifications
   by injecting dye into a pipe containing a flow of water: \parb

   \item<3-> For a sufficiently low velocity,  the dye \newline streak  will remain a well-defined line.
   \newline Adjacent layers in the flow do not mix; \newline this is laminar flow.
   \parb
   \item<4-> For a sufficiently high velocity, the dye \newline streak quickly spreads across
   the pipe, \newline mixing with the water in the pipe. \newline This is turbulent flow.
   \parb
   \item<5-> Between these two conditions is a range of velocities where flow is transitional

  \begin{itemize}
   \item<1-> Not all fluid particles have the same velocity within a pipe \par\vspace{0.5cm}

   \item[]<3-> Velocity is $0$ at the pipe walls.
   \item[]<4->Maximum velocity is at the  centre\newline of the pipe and  is about twice the \newline average velocity of the flow
         \par\vspace{1cm}
         \item<5-> Turbulent flow has a flatter \newline velocity distribution.

 \begin{itemize}
