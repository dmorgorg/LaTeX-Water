\begin{frame}{Minor Losses}

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Fluid flowing in a long straight pipe with uniform diameter assumes a characteristic velocity distribution.
  \item []
  \item A change in direction in some, or all, of the flow will create some turbulence, causing energy loss in
        addition to the normal loss that is due to fluid friction:

\begin{frame}{Minor Losses}

 \begin{textblock*}{0.5\columnwidth}(0.5cm, 1.75cm)

  \begin{itemize}

   \item Losses due to local flow disturbances due to entering or exiting a pipe, changes in pipe cross-section,
         elbows, valves, etc., are known as \textbf{minor losses}.
   \item[]
   \item In the case of a long pipe, these losses are usually small in comparison to the frictional losses in the
         length of pipe.
   \item[]
   \item In a short pipe, such as the suction pipe for a pump with a footvalve and strainer, these losses can be
         considerable and exceed the losses due to friction

  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Resistance Coefficient}

 \begin{itemize}

  \item It has been verified experimentally that the head loss due to valves and fittings is
        proportional to the velocity head of the flow.
        \begin{itemize}
         \item For check valves, this relationship is only true for flows that are sufficient to hold the valve disc in a
               fully open position; we shall assume that this is the case in the situations we investigate
        \end{itemize}
  \item[]
  \item For $h_L\propto\tfrac{v^2}{2g}$, there exists a \textbf{resistance coefficient, $\bm K$}, such that:
        \[ h_L = K\frac{v^2}{2g} \]
  \item $\bm K$-values have been calculated for a variety of situations; they depend upon the geometry of the
        fitting. In some cases, $K$ may also depend upon the velocity of the flow.

 \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Sudden Contraction}

 \begin{itemize}

  \item With a sudden contraction in pipe diameter, there is a marked decrease in pressure due to the increase in
        velocity and due to loss of energy caused by turbulence at the contraction.
  \item []
  \item The resistance to flow due to a sudden contraction depends upon the ratio of the diameters of the pipes
        before and after the contraction. Also, this is a case where the value of $K$ depends upon the flow. Values for $K$
        can be found in tables.
  \item []
  \item The velocity related to the head loss is in the smaller, downstream pipe.

\begin{frame}{Gradual Contraction}

 \begin{itemize}

  \item To reduce losses, sudden changes of cross-section should be avoided where possible.
  \item The resistance to flow due to a gradual contraction is given by:
        \begin{equation*}
         K=
         \begin{cases}
          0.5\sqrt{\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}\left(1-\left(\frac{D_2}{D_1}\right)^2\right), & 45\degree < \theta \le 180\degree
          \\
          0.8\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\left(1-\left(\frac{D_2}{D_1}\right)^2\right),        & 15\degree < \theta \le 45\degree
         \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        where $D_2$ is the smaller (downstream) diameter of the pipe after the contraction and $D_1$ is the diameter of the
        larger (upstream) pipe and \textbf{the head loss is based on the velocity of the smaller pipe}.
  \item Below a cone angle of $15\degree$, the value of $K$ starts to increase again as friction losses due to the
        length of the contraction become significant.	Tables should be consulted to determine the resistance coefficient for
        these contractions.
  \item Rounded ends of the conical transition can reduce the resistance coefficient further still.

\begin{frame}{Equivalent-Length}

 Energy losses incurred by fluid flowing through a valve or fitting is the same as for the minor losses already
 discussed but $K$ is calculated differently:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Friction losses in the very short sections of straight pipe at the valve entrance and exit are so small they
        may be ignored.
  \item Losses are then due to changes in direction of the flow, obstructions in the flow and changes in the
        cross-section and shape of the flow, \textbf{where the flow is fully turbulent}
  \item Let $L_e$ (called the \textbf{equivalent length}) be the length of straight pipe with fully turbulent flow that
        would have the same (equivalent) resistance as the valve or fitting. (That is, if the valve were replaced with length $L_e$ of
        straight pipe, losses would be unchanged.)
  \item Then, if we denote the friction factor for fully turbulent flow by $f_T$,
        \[ h_L = f_T\cdot\frac{L_e}{D}\cdot\frac{v^2}{2g} \]
        But the resistance factor $K$ is defined by the relationship $\displaystyle h_L=K\cdot\frac{v^2}{2g}$ so
        \[ K=f_T\left(\frac{L_e}{D}\right) \]
 \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Equivalent Length Ratio}

 \begin{itemize}

  \item $\frac{L_e}{D}$ is known as the \textbf{equivalent length ratio} and is considered constant for a particular
        type of fitting.\parb
  \item The friction factor for fully turbulent flow, $f_T$, is independent of the Reynolds number. It is that part of
        the Moody Diagram where the curve is horizontal depends only on the relative roughness of the pipe in question.\parb
  \item $f_T$ can be determined in a number of ways:\pars
        \begin{enumerate}
         \item   From the Moody Diagram, most conveniently by drawing a horizontal line directly leftwards from the relative
               roughness scale on the right hand border of the Diagram.\parm
         \item From the Swamee-Jain formula, using a sufficiently high value for the Reynolds number to guarantee complete
               turbulence (such as $N_R=10^8$).\parm
         \item Or, in the case of steel pipe, from the table on the next page\ldots
