% override specific chktex warnings

% chktex-file 1 - ignore commands followed by a space, e.g. \\ new line here
% chktex-file 3 - enclose previous parentheses wit {}
% chktex-file 9 - sometimes messes up with ( and {
% chktex-file 36 - put a space in front of parentheses
% chktex-file 45 - don't use $$ instead of \[, etc
% chktex-file 46 - don't use $ instead of \(, etc
