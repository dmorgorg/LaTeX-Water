	\textbf{Example 5}:
	\begin{cfig}[0.35]{../../figs/04GEE/05GEE-Ex06}\end{cfig}
	A car fuel pump pumps $1\text{ L}$ of gasoline every $45\text{ s}$ when is has a suction pressure of
	$155\text{ mm}$ of mercury vacuum and a discharge pressure of $32\text{ kPa}$. Both the suction and the discharge

	If the pump efficiency is $68\%$, determine the power drawn from the engine.
	\parb
	\textbf{Solution}:
	
	\cbox[0.9]{
		\large
		First, calculate the input pressure:\\
		``$155\text{ mm}$ of mercury vacuum'' means a pressure that is below atmospheric by an amount due to a height of
		$155\text{ mm}$ of mercury.
		\begin{align*}
			\Delta p & = \gamma h                                            \\
			         & = (13.54\times 9.81\;\mathsf{kN/m^3})(0.155\text{ m}) \\

		\end{align*}
		Since this pressure is below atmospheric, it is negative. \lb Thus the inlet pressure is $-20.588\text{ kPa}$.
	}
	\parb
	\cbox[0.9]{
		\large
		Find the head added by the pump. The lines are of the same diameter so velocity heads cancel out. Similarly, the
		lines are at the same elevation so elevation head cancels out too.
		\begin{align*}
			h_A & = \frac{P_{\text{dischage}}-P_{\text{suction}}}{\gamma} \\
			    & = \frac{32-(-20.588)}{0.68\times 9.81}                  \\
