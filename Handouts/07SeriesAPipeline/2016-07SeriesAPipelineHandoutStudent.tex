\textbf{Example 2}:

Gasoline at $25\text{ \textcelsius}$ flows under gravity from tank $A$ to tank $B$; both tanks are open to the
atmosphere.

The $2$-in Schedule $40$ steel pipe has a square entrance is $45.7\text{	m}$ long. The $4$-in Schedule $40$ steel
pipe contains a fully-open globe valve and is $87.5\text{ m}$ long. There is a sudden enlargement between the two
pipes, as shown. Both pipes are new commercial steel. All elbows are standard $90\degree$.

Determine the difference in surface elevation between tanks $A$
and $B$ required to maintain a flow of $425\text{ L/min}$.

\textbf{Example 3}:

Water at $25\text{ \textcelsius}$ is pumped from tank $A$ to tank $B$.
Both tanks are open to the atmosphere.

The suction pipe is $4\text{-in}$ Schedule $40$ steel pipe, has a well-rounded ($r/D>0.15$) entrance, contains a fully
open globe valve, and is $17.0\text{ m}$ long. The discharge pipe is $3\text{-in}$ Schedule $40$ steel pipe, contains a fully open globe valve and
three standard $90\degree$ elbows; it is $163.3\text{ m}$ long.

The elevation difference between $A$ and $B$ is $12.75\text{ m}$ and the volume flow rate is $Q=900\text{ L/min}$.

If the pump is $78\%$ efficient, determine the electrical power it uses.

% \textbf{Example 5}:
%
%
%
%
% The system illustrated is a pumped storage system. During periods of high demand for electricity, water flows down
% from the upper lake and drives the turbine at $D$. (During periods of low demand when electricity is cheap, such as at
% night-time, $D$ acts as a pump and pumps water back up to the upper lake.)
% \par\medskip
% At times of maximum demand, the system has a maximum volume flow rate of $420\;\mathsf{m^3/s}$. Base your
% calculations on this flow. The water is at $10\text{\textcelsius}$.
% \par\medskip
% The difference in elevation between the surfaces of the two lakes is $542\text{	m}$. \par\medskip
% The low pressure tunnel from $A$ to $B$ is $1700\text{ m}$ in length, has a diameter of $10.5\text{ m}$
% and is lined with concrete. The shaft and high pressure tunnel from $B$ to $D$ is $1140\text{ m}$ in length, has a diameter of $10.5\text{ m}$ and
% is lined with welded steel.
% \par\medskip
% There are three tailrace tunnels from the turbine to the lower reservoir with the flow equally
% distributed between them. Each tailrace tunnel is $382\text{ m}$ in
% length, has a diameter of $8.5\text{ m}$ and is lined with concrete.
%
% \par\medskip
% The entrance to the low pressure tunnel at the upper lake has an equivalent length ratio of $Le/D=420$. The bends at
% $B$ and $C$ are in the steel pipe and each have at equivalent length ratio of $16$. A spherical valve at the
% inlet of the turbine that shuts off flow when the turbines are not operating is hydraulically efficient and has no
% losses associated with it. Each tailrace tunnel contains a butterfly valve ($Le/D=20$).
% \par\medskip
% At maximum capacity, the turbine outputs $1800 \text{ MW}$. Determine the efficiency of the turbine at this output.
