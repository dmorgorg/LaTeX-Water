\textbf{Example 9}:
Flow over a rectangular dam spillway is approximately 1150 m$^3$/s. If the width of the spillway is
$32.0\mbox{ m}$ and the depth of the supercritical flow before the hydraulic jump is $1.4$ m,
determine the velocities of the flow before and after the jump, the depth after the jump
and the energy dissipated.

\textbf{Example 10}:
Flow from a reservoir (i.e. it has no initial velocity) into a rectangular channel is controlled by a sluice gate as shown. Verify that the flow after the gate is supercritical and determine the depth of flow downstream from the jump.

\textbf{Example 11}:
Water flows from a reservoir with a depth of 3.60 m down a trapezoidal concrete-lined channel ($n=0.017$) with a base width of $4.0$ m and a side slope value of $z=2.5$.\parm
Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The flow under critical conditions (when specific energy is at a minimum)
	\item The slope required to give critical flow
\end{enumerate}
